# Bank-Churn-Prediction
This dataset contains information about customers of the bank. Some of them still remain as loyal members of the bank while others  are withdrawing their bank accounts. For each customer, there is information about the customer's surname, account balance, credit score, geography, gender, age and whether the customer is still an active member of the bank, etc. In this project, I first did some data cleaning, then I did some visualization using tools such as matplotlib and seaborn to explore and understand the relationship among various numerical and categorical features. Lastly, I trained supervised learning models such as logistic regression, random forest and K-nearest neighbors (KNN) to predict customer churn probability and used feature engineering to select the features that are important to cause the customer to churn.
